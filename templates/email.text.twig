Dear {{ name }},

During the last few months, the University of Utrecht (http://www.uu.nl/en) has run a research project on contributions by companies to open source communities. While studying the software ecosystem around Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/) on Github (https://github.com/eclipse), your profile has popped up on the radar.

Based on publicly available information, your employer has been identified as: {{company}}.

To validate the findings of the research project, could you please indicate whether this is correct? Please open http://www.jakobbuis.nl/uucsva/{{uuid}}/correct in your browser if this is correct. Open http://www.jakobbuis.nl/uucsva/{{uuid}}/wrong if this is wrong.

Kind regards,
Jakob Buis
